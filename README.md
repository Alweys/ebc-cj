* This is a [Codjumper](http://www.codjumper.com/) based modification for Explicit Bouncers CJ Server. This is still a beta version and has many issues to be solved still. Release version should be available soon.
* This repository contains all you need for a fully working CoD4 / CoD4X server, along with files to compile the complete mod. Contact me if perhaps some rawfiles are missing that were not in the mod folder at the time of the base file upload.
* Feel free to contribute to the project, even if you are not a developer. All suggestions and bug reports are welcome to help us improve this mod.

## Credits and copyright
Thanks to following people: original codjumper dev team for the base mod, 3xp clan, semtex clan and everyone else involved on this project. Note that the header file credits were removed by me, someone else working on the project or were downloaded in that state. If you see your original code please contact me to add the credits here (if you wish so), the reason behind this is a more clean code and ease of development, we appreciate all the developers and credit them here where the mod is available to the public. 
Most of the code has been reworked a lot as well to suit our needs and fix existing bugs and you would not even recognize it as yours but we didnt stamp our credit/copyright there because we respect all the previous developers and we ask future developers who will take this code to also respect the origins and provide credits and not label it as yours. 
You are allowed to use this code, modify it and share it as long as you keep the credits.
